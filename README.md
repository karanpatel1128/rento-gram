Application Description
Our application is a peer-to-peer product rental and hosting platform that allows users to host their products for rent and enables other users to rent those products easily. It serves as a marketplace where users can monetize their unused or underutilized items by renting them out, and others can save money by renting items instead of purchasing them.

Whether itâ€™s electronics, furniture, vehicles, or appliances, the application connects owners with renters in a seamless and secure manner, creating a collaborative sharing economy.
